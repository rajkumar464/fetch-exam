# Fetch Take-Home ML Assessment

This is an app to predict the receipt counts for the year 2022.<br>
Please navigate to 'app' folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your Terminal.<br>
Then type `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`<br>

# Docker

I attempted to dockerize the application and while the app runs, I ran into some issues with PyTorch.
